. Setup:
    1. In command line: (in the same directory)
        - composer install
            - this to install laravel and all the packages

    2. edit .env file: (required)
        - search for:
            DB_CONNECTION=mysql
            DB_HOST=mysql
            DB_PORT=3306
            DB_DATABASE=GIVE_A_DATABASE_NAME
            DB_USERNAME=YOUR_MYSQL_USERNAME
            DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD
            
    3. (required)
        - since Storing, Updating and Deleting from db needs authentication
          and user must verify his email
          recommended: Mailtrap (for email testing) - visit: https://mailtrap.io and register
          
          - Note: later will be changed with an official smtp email
        
        - then: search in .env file and edit the following:

            MAIL_MAILER=smtp
            MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
            MAIL_PORT=2525
            MAIL_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME_ON_MAILTRAP(ID)
            MAIL_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD_ON_MAILTRAP
            MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
            MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@example.com"
            MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}" 

    4. in command line : (in same directory)
        -php artisan migrate --seed
            - to migrate all tables in to the database
            - --seed: to create to generate roles(admin, user) in db and create first user with:
                 = email: test@test.test
                 = password: password 

    5. in command line:
        - php artisan serve
            - this will run the php/laravel server

    6. after all these steps, now we can test the endpoints/routes
        - using postman (recommended)


. Testing the endpoints:
    - all routes are located in /routes/api_v1.php
    - Authentication uses sanctum token which needs to be inserted as a header as: 
        authentication: 'Bearer ApiToken given after register/login'
    - after authenticating/registering or logining in
        make sure that the email is verified

    - postman: import the file
        - postman is structured as follows:
            - each table in databse has its folder


. How to use with postman:
    1.import postman json file
    2. in Auth section:
        choose login: the route should look like: http://localhost/api/v1/login
            then send login fields as body FormData or  boy row json
                email: test@test.test
                password: password
    3. copy the token that is returned as response
    4. paste the token in the top folder named (develution)
        under: Autherization
        select type: Bearer Token   -> paste the token here
    5. now the user is authenticated as admin, it is auto generated as admin
    6. note that any new registered user its role is user, to change it a logged in admin only can change it
    7. be sure to verify the email after new registered user
    8. now all the endpoints can be tested one by one
